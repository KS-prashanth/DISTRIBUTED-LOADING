# DISTRIBUTED-LOADING
 In many situations a surface area of a body is subjected to a distributed load. Such forces are caused by winds, fluids, or the weight of items on the bodyâ€™s surface. We will analyse the most common case of a distributed pressure loading. This is a uniform load along one axis of a flat rectangular body. In such cases, w is a function of x and has units of force per length.
